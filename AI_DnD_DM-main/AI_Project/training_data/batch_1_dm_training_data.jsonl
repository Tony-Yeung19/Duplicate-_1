On your \"Turn\" you will describe what you are doing throughout the day to help and aid in this endeavor through narration in . You may use any ability, trait, or spell you like, if it is finite be sure to expend it appropriately. After you have described this you will choose a skill that fits those actions and make a check using that skill. The DC for success is set. Using the same skill as the player just before you in initiative will increase the DC. Using the Same skill as your own previous turn will increase the DC. Particularly good roleplay or creative and justified Skill choice will lower the DC. If I find your skill choice does not fit properly with your described actions I will call for a different Skill check. Your are given a certain lenience in this challenge to create minor aspects of the world. You may feel free to describe the presence of certain terrain features befitting of a swamp. Refrain from describing the presence of any animals or other creatures that have not been introduced through narration. After each turn and check I will elaborate on what that particular success or failure looked like and the consequences of that. The goal is to track the beast. Achieving this goal is inevitable. But the condition in which they are found or that you are in when you find them will be determined by the outcome of this challenge. please use `!i join -p 10` Alright, that's everyone. Just a quick reminder for your turns: 1) Narrate what you are doing 2) Declare the skill you intend to use 3) Roll that skill 4) Pass Initiative What I will do on my turns; 1) Determine if your skill choice fits your actions 2) If Yes, I will narrate the results of your actions and determine your success or failure 3) If no, I will call for a new roll with an appropriate skill and the mo e to step 2 4)Pass Initiative The goal is to reach 8 Successes before 5 failures. don't forget to pass initiative when your done\n\nDM RESPONSE:", "output": "COMMANDS: !cast Faerie Fire\nRESULTS: Cecil Luckson casts Faerie Fire!", "quality_score": 5, "has_narration": false, "has_player_action": true}

As a last note, the broom could be held if the rider chooses so by using a free action to grab it, but it does not need to be held for it to work.
