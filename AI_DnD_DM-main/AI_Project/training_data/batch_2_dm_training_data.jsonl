Or perhaps to catch a fish, if it feels like it. As it grows closer, though, its ears pick up the melody from a flute on top of the river's churning. Growing interested, it moves slowly towards the source of the sound, taking care to move quietly to avoid attention. Its eyes peek through the trees to see who might have been strange enough to come so deep in the forests today.*\n\nDM RESPONSE:", "output": "COMMANDS: !attack \"Wild Shape\"\nRESULTS: Rynn (Starheart) uses Wild Shape! Rynn (Starheart) gained Wild Shape.\nNARRATION: *Realizing that it had likely been noticed as the tune stops, the wolf hesitantly takes a step past the border of the trees, but remains crouched and cautious. The being in front of her was unfamiliar, though the horns on the figure caught her attention. She saw types like it in the town. They were called... t.. teethlings? Teevlings? Something of the sort. They acted like everybody else, but she remembers hearing negatively about them from humans in the tavern. They were fiends. Just like the githyanki... Her eyes squint as she takes a stance ready to pounce at a moment's notice.* *The wolf grows curiouser. Was she not spotted? Why does the teethling not turn? Surely the approach of a creature while alone would prompt some sort of fear.. or at least interest. It's only natural to know what approaches. Maybe the girl has no fear as she welcomes all spirits of the wild? Or does she not care what comes of her? The questions kept coming in the wolf's head as slowly, almost subconsciously, it took more steps towards the horned flute-player. Still, its stance remained low, as if approaching prey.* *Only a few feet from the woman now, the wolf cranes its head closer, trying to look in front of her to see if there is anything in particular that catches her attention. With no reaction, the wolf begins to wonder if the river is simply too loud - and maybe the song has found its end. Walking to the side of the woman, but far enough to avoid being grabbed, the wolf's eyes look at the flute in her lap and out across the waters to see if another had captured her gaze. But nothing was there. Confused, the wolf begins to venture closer, coming within reach of the girl.* *Almost as quickly as it entered the woman's reach, the wolf backs up with an unprecedented speed at this display. Fear is apparent in its eyes as it cries out with a yelp and turns with its tail between its legs. It was a demon, there was no doubt about it. A fiend! The humans were right - teethlings should be feared. She could only imagine how fast her body would perish if it suffered a touch from the nightmarish entity - in fact, she felt drained just from its wicked, empty stare. Still yelping from fear, it attempts to run back into the woods, wanting to put distance between itself and.. and that embodiment of evil!*", "quality_score": 7, "has_narration": true, "has_player_action": true}
