Find someone else to share your love with, and bring them back to me to share together...\" She also knew deep down she could do the same, but firstly had made the promise to never do so to Player 26, and right now was baffled at the idea that she would ever have the audacity to openly flirt in such a manner that could lead to that situation.\n\nDM RESPONSE:", "output": "COMMANDS: !cast false -i\nRESULTS: Nua casts False Life!
