Well, I wasn't having any of that, no sir!\" *There's a heavy stone door on the left, sealed with a glowing-white glyph. The old man tries the handle, but it won't budge.* \"So you know what I did? I bought him and his wife a vacation! Found a nice little demiplane, close to Arborea, paid for the portals an' everything. Only, you know what this plane has? *Enhanced fertility.* Oh yes. I didn't tell him, neither.\" *He waggles his eyebrows.* \"And my daughter-in-law didn't want to go, 'cos she was worried about the vaults.

The seal on the door disintegrates.* \"There!\" *says the vaultkeeper.* \"No problem. In you go!\" *The door creaks open on what seems to be a restaurant...* *The vaultkeeper is an elderly human, wearing shining armor with a holy symbol you don't recognize, walking with a cane.* \"You remind me of my boy,\" *he tells you.* \"So young! So confident!\" \"Step right this way...\" *he adds. He leads you into the labyrinthine stone tunnels of the Vault.* \"M'boy got killed, mind,\" *he adds.* \"Pack of manticores. He was a little too confident, he was. It was quick, at least.\" *Right turn, right turn, another right turn. The vaultkeeper looks confused for a moment. He turns back and leads you back up the corridor you just walked down.* \"And they was all getting ready to get him raised, and I said, oh, no. No no no, we're going to reincarnate him instead, I know a druid.\" \"And they was worried, because what if he came back as a goblin or something? But I didn't worry. Not my boy!
